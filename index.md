# Crane Project Team 30
## Sarah Jurgens, Hans Kumar, Sidney Velado

### Mechanism:

Our crane is divided into three main parts: The lever arm, the crane arm, and the base. Each part was designed to prevent what torsion and bending, the two main challenges we forsaw in this project. The way our mechanism works is by putting as much stress on the base, as it is the most structurally sound. To put in perspective, everything starts at the lever arm. the lever arm has a "hook" that connect with the weight in order to lift it. The lever arm is screwed into the servo motor horn in order to turn and lift the weight. Additionally, it has a counter weight at the opposite end of the hook, in order to assist the servo motor in lifting the weight. That servo motor is screwed into our crane arm. The crane arm is a triagular cross section truss. It's design allows it to resist the torsion and bending caused by the lever arm and servo. The crane arm is then screwed into our base, which supports the whole crane, with a similar trust design. That is then secured to the bottom metal plate, which is held in place by two metal clamps. 

### Theoretical Predictions

**Theoretical Servo Torque Calculations**

 1. Assumptions
 - We assume that no forces being applied to the motor (i.e. friction)


 2. Variables
```markdown
- T = 56 oz-in (Maximum torque of Servo motor)
- W = 16 oz (Weight of the cylinder)
- D = 2 in (Distance between motor and weight)
- Tu = Torque of Motor used
- r = ? (Ratio maximum torque used)
```
 3. Calculations

 4. Results
 We estimate to use 56.14% of the motor's torque with our design. 
 
**Theoretical Life Distance Calculations**

 1. Assumptions
 - We assume that that the torque and angle of rotation vary linearly
 
 2. Variables 
```markdown
- øm = 90º (Maximum angle of rotation)
- hm = 2 in (Maximum height of lift)
- r = 56.14% (Ratio of max torque used)
- ø = ? (Actual angle of rotation)
- h = ? (Actual height of lift)
```
 3. Calculations
 //Will have updated calc
