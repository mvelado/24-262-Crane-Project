### Mechanism:

Our crane is divided into three main parts: The lever arm, the crane arm, and the base. Each part was designed to prevent what torsion and bending, the two main challenges we forsaw in this project. The way our mechanism works is by putting as much stress on the base, as it is the most structurally sound. To put in perspective, everything starts at the lever arm. the lever arm has a "hook" that connect with the weight in order to lift it. The lever arm is screwed into the servo motor horn in order to turn and lift the weight. Additionally, it has a counter weight at the opposite end of the hook, in order to assist the servo motor in lifting the weight. That servo motor is screwed into our crane arm. The crane arm is a triagular cross section truss. It's design allows it to resist the torsion and bending caused by the lever arm and servo. The crane arm is then screwed into our base, which supports the whole crane, with a similar trust design. That is then secured to the bottom metal plate, which is held in place by two metal clamps. 

### Theoretical Predictions

**Theoretical Servo Torque Calculations**

 1. Assumptions
 - We assume that no forces being applied to the motor (i.e. friction)


 2. Variables
```markdown
- T = 56 oz-in (Maximum torque of Servo motor)
- W = 16 oz (Weight of the cylinder)
- D = 2 in (Distance between motor and weight)
- Tu = Torque of Motor used
- r = ? (Ratio maximum torque used)
```

 4. Results
 We estimate to use 56.14% of the motor's torque with our design. 
 
**Theoretical Lift Distance Calculations**

 1. Assumptions
 - We assume that that the torque and angle of rotation vary linearly
 
 2. Variables 
```markdown
- øm = 90º (Maximum angle of rotation)
- hm = 2 in (Maximum height of lift)
- r = 56.14% (Ratio of max torque used)
- ø = ? (Actual angle of rotation)
- h = ? (Actual height of lift)
```
 3. Calculations

**Interesting and Original Features**

One of our favorite parts of our project was our crane arm truss. Many people went with a rectangular designs or went with diagonal truss links. We decided to do our with the straight triangles because it appeared the sturdiest in terms of torsion. We knew that the holding the weight was going to be the priority for everyone, but the fact that they ingore torsion was going to make or break a lot of teams. Our arm truss was *very* resistant to torsion. Even though past the first designing phase we had to tweak certain parts of the lever arm or base, the crane arm was the most resilient component. We were also very proud because it's design made it very hard to screw since multiple screws would get in each other's way but we managed to do it after a big effor and it paid off.
